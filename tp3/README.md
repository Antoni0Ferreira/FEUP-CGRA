## TP 3 Notes

- In the first part of the given exercises, we experimented with the various lights, materials and controls, in order for us to become more comfortable with these concepts.
- We also defined the normals for the MyUnitCube and MyTangram elements created in the the last class, which led to the disappearance of the light inconsistencies we evidenced earlier.

- In exercise 4, we created a wood material and applied it on our unit cube:
